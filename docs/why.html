      <h2>Why another framework?</h2>
      <p> 
        Why not use Bootstrap, like everybody else? Or one of the hundreds other libraries and frameworks that already exist? </p>
      <p>I guess I'm just one of those people that want to make sites the way I want. Not to be forced into another API and forced to update the system. Or wakre up one morning the site doesn't work anymore, because this-or-that new library from party X has to be included.</p>
      <br/>
      <p>So I created a framework based on the way I want to build a site.<br/>
      Without any dependencies on whatsever other library. Just plain HTML, CSS and Javascript. </p>
      <p>So this means I can build a site and because forementioned techniques are Open Standards, it will be backwards compatibel and completely future safe.</p>
      <p>
         I can make a site with this framework and it will work in any modern browser, and it will work for a considerable time, for years on, without any updates.  </p>
      <p>
         and so can you. </p>
      <p>
         Besides that, it's build as simple as possible with a minimum of code.  </p>
