# dreamFrame

Version 0.5

Almost ready for production. 
This framework lets you build simple websites.

Files to use as templates:

- index.html
a HTML / CSS only template. 

- index-js.html
Navigation and footer will be loaded by javascript, so any file in the site by default will use the same navigation and footer. Duplicate, rename and change these files to use multiple navigation or footer files...
